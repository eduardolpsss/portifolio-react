                            Development of the system responsible for controlling the university's social projects and extension projects. The project was developed from the requirements survey done directly with the client, the prototyping was done in Figma in a responsive way using UI/UX concepts using UI/UX concepts, I worked actively in the front-end team using React, Next, the Material-UI component library library and Axios for the RESTful requests. I helped the team responsible for the back-end (Node.js) of the system. Project developed with the help of agile methods and CBL, the responsive web application (MVP) was developed in order to automate the whole current structure, which involves teachers, students and foreigners in the process of administration, registration and participation in projects. The system is currently being tested with a class of 75 students.
